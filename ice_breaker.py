    info = """Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the 
    founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner, 
    CTO, and chairman of Twitter; founder of the Boring Company and X Corp.; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and 
    president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation. Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to the 
    Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's Real Time Billionaires list as of June 2023, primarily from his 
    ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, with an estimated net worth of around $225 billion according to Bloomberg 
    and $235 billion according to Forbes.[4][5][6]

Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at 
age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's 
University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and 
physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. After two days, he dropped out and, 
with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq 
for $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal, 
which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.

With $175.8 million, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he was an early investor 
in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product 
architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was 
later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence 
research company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer 
interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has also proposed a hyperloop high-speed 
vactrain transportation system. In 2022, his acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion was completed.

Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and 
misleading statements, including that of spreading COVID-19 misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. Musk 
stepped down as chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of a settlement agreement with the SEC."""
