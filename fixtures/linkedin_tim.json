They can tell amazing stories of their path to Rocky Mountain Ruby, and they are going to be wonderful additions to our community. A guide's job is to help us welcome them and make them feel at home!\n\nWhile there is certainly an intangible component of what makes a great Guide, there are also a few things that we're looking for specifically:\n\n* Guides should be comfortable being available as a friendly face for their Scholars throughout the whole conference. \n* Guides should be able to recommend great talks for Scholars to attend after hearing about their interests, current skill levels, and experiences.\n* Guides should be comfortable making introductions between Scholars and established developers, especially ones that might be influential in \u0003 the Scholars' areas of interest.\n* Guides should be able to give feedback on breaking into the Ruby world, especially for Scholars looking for their first Ruby or Rails gig!\n* Guides should be great community ambassadors!",
